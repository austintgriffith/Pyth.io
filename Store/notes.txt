test to see if an automatic getter is generated for the mapping, if not the getPrice will be needed


build a "better" store that has the last updated time as a struct for the mapping

maybe the getPrice could even check for a descendant and then call getPrice on it (that doesn't work, it'll have to happen off chain)

Let's think of the EthVsBch as our "client" and we are their oracle

EthVsBch will just tell us if Eth or Bch is worth more at any time and it needs to stay up to date and never go down
