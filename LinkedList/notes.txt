keeping track of names with a corresponding number, maybe like votes or something
(Assuming that these counts are coming in from a trusted, secure contract)
all data is stored in an object that is then reference by bytes32 hashes
we will create a head link and then each object links to their next
we will add to the head (this is the cheapest way vs adding to middle or sorting live or something)
we keep track of length mainly to provide a nonce for the hash

node contract getHead LinkedList

node contract addEntry LinkedList null 93 "Bram"

node contract getHead LinkedList

node contract addEntry LinkedList null 67 "Eric"

node contract getHead LinkedList

events that are only tracked off chain can easily show you everything and everything is public:

node contract eventsAddEntry LinkedList

add in a bunch of entries with:
./LinkedList/populate.sh

Now let's say we need to have a certain total of votes counted before we can reach a consensus
we can get a total count off-chain easily because it talks to one local node

node contract getTotal LinkedList

BUT, as soon as we want to change some state at the end of that it gets expensive

node contract setTotal LinkedList
node contract getWrittenTotal LinkedList

node contract resetTotal LinkedList

demo this by setting the total to "writtenTotal" and then running reset total and looking at the difference in gas usage

we should also compare the difference in gas cost between setTotal and resetTotal because that difference is simply the cost of navigating the
linked list and keeping a running total (which is free when you don't write state!)

notice that if another contract needed to get the total and then perform some action that changes state,
you would want to use the writtentotal, but in terms of off chain interaction, getTotal is better because
you get a live total every time and cost doesn't matter
Again it really doesn't make sense to get the total and write it to the contract, it's better to add it up off chain every time!?
BUT once you need this data ON chain you probably want to run through once and write the results

Since it's free off chain,  we could count votes off chain, but then we would be writing it back to the chain.. BUT that could be manipulated
the whole point of this is to absolutely deterministic and trustless... only the law of the machines etc



okay so let's look at a second contract called "Teller" that will count votes



questions -

  what about running out of gas? maybe we need to count the votes in steps and make multiple calls?
  (msg.gas gives remaining gas)

  what if we wanted to make it expensive to cast a vote, could we put a hash mine right into the add entry function?
