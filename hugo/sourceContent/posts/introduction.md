Blockchain technologies, smart contracts in particular, are incredibly powerful and are posed to disrupt many aspects of financial and business sectors.

However, due to the deterministic and decentralized nature of smart contracts, they are unable to communicate directly with valuable data sources on the internet.

An oracle provides that link by making requests and delivering results to the blockchain.

Unfortunately, only centralized oracles exist today and contracts are forced to rely on a single point of failure which could easily be attacked, manipulated, and corrupted.

A decentralized, trust-less network of oracles is needed to empower the next generation of smart contracts. This system must also take into account the cryptoeconomics of incentivizing miners to enrich the blockchain.  

A statistically adequate amount of miners requesting information from multiple internet sources, in combination with the staking of a token and cpu, can reach a blind, agreed upon consensus off-chain, and then efficiently inscribe data publicly onto the blockchain.
