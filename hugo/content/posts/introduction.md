Blockchain technologies, smart contracts in particular, are incredibly powerful but are unable to communicate directly with information on the internet.
An oracle provides that link by making requests, delivering results, and most importantly, forming a consensus on the blockchain.

No single, centralized content provider is reliable enough to source advanced, deterministically binding contracts that dictate the exchange of wealth.
A statistically adequate amount of miners, in combination with the staking of a currency and cpu, can reach an agreed upon value in a trust-less fashion.

This currency must, in turn, be of some value to incentivize miners to continue making requests, forming consensus, and enriching the blockchain.
ICOs are earning millions of dollars and backing the development of amazing new products, but RequestCoin can only be earned through mining.

The following is an exploration into somehow incentivizing and building a reliable link between smart contracts and the internet with cryptographically and statistically accurate information.
