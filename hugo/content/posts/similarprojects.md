There are a handful of extremely interesting projects in this space.

The most similar is [ChainLink](https://link.smartcontract.com/). These guys have a tremendous amount of momentum and we wish we would have found them earlier. [ChainLink](https://link.smartcontract.com/) is way out ahead of RequestCoin and has far greater expectations for their product.

There are also a bunch of good projects working in the prediction market space. This is similar to decentralized oracles because they require a network of clients to verify events. Most notably, [Augur](https://augur.net/) and [Gnosis](https://gnosis.pm/), have built and launched their networks already.

Many smaller projects are emerging that are also helping to enrich the space. For example, [tinyoracle](https://github.com/axic/tinyoracle) is a great little example project for building a baseline oracle.

All projects in this space will work to enrich the value and accuracy by providing more and more disparate sources for off-chain content. In the end, the best way to build an on-chain consensus will probably to use a combination of all networks. *we will try to keep adding to this list as we find new, similar projects*
